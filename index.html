          <p class="card_description">For the longest time, I’ve 
            made the search for truth and meaning a priority 
            in my life. From reading deeply in spirituality, 
            philosophy, and psychology to prayer, journaling, 
            and meditation, I’ve tried hard to integrate my 
            actions with my beliefs.</p>

            to my close friends all around the US, I’ve found 
            the relationships and connections I’ve built with 
            them to be rewarding, refreshing, challenging, and 
            therapeutic. </p>

            engineering of one type or another for over 6 years. I 
            really love the technical-creative nature of it. Although
             I’ve met with many obstacles, my interest in the field 
             is strong, and I feel hopeful about the future. </p>
